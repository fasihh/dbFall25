a) What are the problems with File system data management?
There are many problems, e.g 
- it provides no default measures to ensure data integrity
- it becomes very difficult to keep the data up to date in a multi-user environment
- it is easily prone to data redundancy issues
- it has no built in user authorization mechanisms, risking security
- no queries

e) A key is a superkey but not vice versa. Explain this statement with an example.
A super key is a key consisting of multiple attributes to create a valid key. However, it may not always be a key
